Garbage Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Methods and MobileNet Architecture in Deep Learning

Recognition and management of waste is one of the main challenges in efforts to maintain environmental cleanliness and sustainability. To overcome these challenges, Deep Learning-based technologies have developed rapidly, especially in complex image classification tasks, such as garbage classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), as one of the most efficient deep learning architectures, is widely used in pattern recognition and object classification in images. However, to speed up the classification process and reduce the use of computing resources, lightweight architectures such as MobileNet can also be implemented.

MobileNet is a variant of the CNN architecture designed for devices with limited resources, such as smartphones or IoT devices. MobileNet optimizes the computational process by using techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions, which significantly reduce the number of parameters and computational operations required compared to conventional CNNs, without sacrificing classification performance.

In the context of waste classification, the combination of CNN and MobileNet architecture allows the system to recognize and classify waste into predefined categories (e.g., plastic, paper, glass, organic, and metal) with high accuracy and computational efficiency. The first stage involves collecting a dataset of trash images from various categories. Once the dataset is prepared, a CNN model with MobileNet architecture is trained using the data. The model learns to extract important features from images, such as shape, texture, and color, which helps in identifying types of waste.

The main advantage of using MobileNet in waste classification is its ability to run quickly and efficiently on devices with computational limitations. This is especially useful in real-world scenarios where automated waste management systems can be implemented on mobile devices or distributed systems with limited processing power. MobileNet ensures that even if the model used is lightweight, the level of classification accuracy remains high, which is critical for applications that require fast response and resource efficiency.

By implementing Waste Classification using CNN with MobileNet architecture, we can create a solution that is not only effective in identifying and classifying waste, but also efficient in terms of resource use. This opens up huge opportunities for wider application of AI technology to support sustainability efforts and better waste management, especially in areas with limited technological infrastructure.
